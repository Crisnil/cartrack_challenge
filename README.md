# Objective: To build a web application that shows a list of current Team users using React.

 

Requirements:

    To display a list of the current Team users using React
    The endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users  should be used to fetch the users.
    Provide users the ability to search by name and email. Search must be case-insensitive. Filtering other fields is a plus.
    The user must be able to navigate the interface via keyboard arrows OR tabs.
    The user must be able to contact a Team member via email and telephone number link.
    The whole application must be responsive on modern desktop browsers as well as mobile devices.
    It must be able to handle empty results. 

 

Technologies:

    ReactJS,  Typescript, functional components, and Webpack
    Linters and/or unit testing
    We want to see that you are using an up-to-date stack (at least ES6 standard for JS, HTML5, CSS3)
    Don't use any CSS Frameworks, we want to see your hand written abilities in styling. 
    Don't use any utility library (e.g. lodash, underscore). All logic should be written in pure javascript functions.
    If a boilerplate is used, ALL unnecessary code must be removed._
